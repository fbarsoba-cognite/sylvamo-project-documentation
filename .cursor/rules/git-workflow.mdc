# Git Workflow

## Prefer separate commits over amending

- Always create **new, separate commits** for follow-up fixes or iterations.
- Do NOT use `git commit --amend` or `git push --force` unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- This preserves a full audit trail of what was tried and why.

## Example

If a CI pipeline fails after a push:

```bash
# GOOD: new commit with the fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix(module): correct the X issue from previous commit"
git push

# BAD: amend + force push (loses history)
git commit --amend
git push --force-with-lease
```
