# Sylvamo Project Documentation (Canonical Rule)

> **This is the canonical rule set.** All Sylvamo projects share rules from sylvamo-project-documentation/.cursor/rules/.  
> **Related:** [@code_change_workflow](.cursor/rules/code_change_workflow.mdc) | [@git-workflow](.cursor/rules/git-workflow.mdc)

## Canonical Location

**All docs must be edited in sylvamo-project-documentation:**

- **Repo:** https://github.com/fbarsoba-cognite/sylvamo-project-documentation
- **Path:** ../sylvamo-project-documentation (sibling to sylvamo workspace)

## Do NOT Edit

- github-docs-clone/ (inside the sylvamo ADO repo)
- Any other clone or copy of the docs repo

## Content Routing

When adding or updating docs, use this mapping:

| Content Type | Destination |
|--------------|-------------|
| Data model, transformations, PPV | docs/reference/data-model/ |
| Extractors, data sources | docs/reference/extractors/ |
| Architecture, ADRs, changelog | docs/reference/data-model/decisions/, changelog/ |
| CI/CD | docs/reference/cicd/ |
| Files, P&ID, contextualization | docs/reference/files/ |
| Use cases, workflows | docs/reference/use-cases/, docs/reference/workflows/ |
| Current sprint plans | docs/internal/sprint-planning/ |
| Completed sprints | docs/archive/YYYY-MM-sprintN-completed/ |
| Deprecated designs | docs/archive/YYYY-MM-deprecated/ |
| Presentations | docs/presentations/ |

## Workflow

1. Choose the destination from the table above.
2. Update docs/README.md and the root README.md in the matching topic group.
3. Edit only in the sylvamo-project-documentation worktree.
4. If edits were made in github-docs-clone or elsewhere, revert them.

## ALWAYS Push After Making Changes

**After editing any file in sylvamo-project-documentation, commit and push to GitHub.**

```bash
cd ../sylvamo-project-documentation
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "SVQS-XXX: Brief description"
git pull --rebase
git push
```
