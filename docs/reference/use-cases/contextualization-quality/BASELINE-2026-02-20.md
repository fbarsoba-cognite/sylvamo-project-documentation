# Contextualization Quality Baseline Results (`sylvamo-dev`)

**Run type:** API-driven batch mode (UI workaround)  
**Batch plan:** 10 batches x 5,000 (target 50,000)  
**Total runtime:** ~196s for batch+aggregation  
**Computed at (UTC):** 2026-02-20T20:01:12Z

---

## 1) Batch Configuration (UI-equivalent)

- **Batch size:** 50,000 total, executed as 5,000 increments via API
- **Number of batches:** 10
- **Why API:** UI minimum (50,000) was causing graph query timeout; API increments avoided this

**Status:** **OK**

---

## 2) Batch Execution (UI-equivalent)

- **Submitted batches:** 10/10
- **Completed batches:** 10/10
- **Failed batches:** 0
- **Aggregation:** Completed

**Status:** **OK**

---

## 3) Metrics Info (UI-equivalent)

- **Execution time (final metrics file):** 1.91s (aggregation write step)
- **Batch mode:** true
- **Batches merged:** 10

**Status:** **OK**

---

## 4) Instance Counts (UI-equivalent)

- **Assets:** 45,953 (unique 45,953; duplicates 0)
- **Time Series:** 3,764 (unique 3,764; duplicates 0)
- **Equipment:** 0
- **Notifications:** 0
- **Maintenance Orders:** 0

**Status:**
- Assets/TS counts: **OK**
- Equipment/Maintenance counts: **NOT OK** (no equipment/maintenance data represented in this baseline run)

---

## 5) Processing Status (UI-equivalent)

- Data pipeline execution completed and metrics persisted to CDF file.

**Status:** **OK**

## 6) Dashboard Configuration Sections (as shown in UI)

## 6.1 Asset Hierarchy Dashboard

### Key results
- **Hierarchy completion rate:** 100.0%
- **Orphan rate:** 0.0% (orphans: 0)
- **Root assets:** 2
- **Average depth:** 5.93
- **Max depth:** 7
- **Average children:** 5.18
- **Max children:** 164

### Assessment
- **What is OK**
  - Structural completeness is strong (100% completion, zero orphans).
  - Depth profile looks mature (deep but coherent hierarchy).
- **What is NOT OK / watchlist**
  - Very high max breadth (164 children) suggests some high-fanout parent nodes worth reviewing for modeling quality/readability.

**Section status:** **OK with watch items**

---

## 6.2 Time Series Dashboard

### Key results
- **TS -> Asset association rate:** 94.9% (3,572 linked / 3,764 total)
- **TS without asset link:** 192
- **Asset monitoring coverage:** 0.04% (only 18 assets associated with TS)
- **Source unit completeness:** 61.56%
- **Target unit completeness:** 0.0%
- **Any unit completeness:** 61.56%
- **Data freshness:** 100.0%
- **Processing lag:** 15.66 hours

### Assessment
- **What is OK**
  - TS linkage quality is high at TS-record level (94.9% linked).
  - Freshness is strong (100% fresh).
- **What is NOT OK**
  - Asset-level TS coverage is very low (0.04%) -> weak monitoring coverage across asset population.
  - Unit metadata is incomplete, especially target units (0%).
- **Not evaluable yet**
  - Critical asset coverage and unit mapping rate are `None` (no critical set / mapping context in this run).

**Section status:** **PARTIALLY OK (major improvement needed on coverage + unit metadata)**

---

## 6.3 Equipment-Asset Dashboard

### Key results
- **Total equipment:** 0
- **Association rate:** 0.0%
- **Asset coverage by equipment:** 0.0%
- **Serial/manufacturer completeness:** 0.0%

### Assessment
- **What is OK**
  - N/A (no equipment population in result set).
- **What is NOT OK**
  - Equipment contextualization is not represented in baseline metrics.
  - Any equipment KPI is currently non-actionable until equipment data is populated and linked.

**Section status:** **NOT OK (data gap)**

---

## 6.4 Maintenance Workflow Dashboard

- **Maintenance metrics payload:** empty

**Section status:** **NOT OK / NOT AVAILABLE** (no maintenance data processed in this baseline)

---

## 6.5 File Annotation Dashboard

- **File annotation metrics payload:** empty

**Section status:** **NOT OK / NOT AVAILABLE** (no annotation data processed in this baseline)

---

## 7) Overall Baseline Verdict

- **Strong:** Asset hierarchy structure and TS record-level linking quality.
- **Weak:** Asset monitoring coverage (TS spread across assets), equipment contextualization visibility, maintenance and annotation coverage.
- **Immediate focus areas:**
  1. Increase TS coverage across assets (not just TS link quality).
  2. Populate/validate equipment links so equipment KPIs become meaningful.
  3. Improve unit metadata completeness (especially target units).
  4. Bring maintenance and annotation datasets into baseline scope if expected.
